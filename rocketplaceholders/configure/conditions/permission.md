# Permission Condition

This condition is easy to use.

Just set the type to [PERMISSION](https://rocketplaceholders.jd.rocketplugins.space/me/lorenzo0111/rocketplaceholders/creator/conditions/RequirementType.html#PERMISSION) and a value.

Example:

```yaml
conditions:
    permissionExample:
        type: PERMISSION
        value: "example.permission"
        text: "Example condition text"
```
