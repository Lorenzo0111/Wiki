# Group Condition

This condition is easy to use.

Just set the type to [GROUP](https://jd.rocketplugins.space/rocketplaceholders/me/lorenzo0111/rocketplaceholders/creator/conditions/RequirementType.html#GROUP) and a value.

Example:

```yaml
conditions:
    permissionExample:
        type: GROUP
        value: "ExampleGroup"
        text: "Example condition text"
```
