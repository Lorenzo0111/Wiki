# RocketPlaceholders custom placeholders

placeholders:

  0: # Only numbers (CHANGE IT, DO NOT USE THE 0 NUMBER)
    placeholder: "test" #ex "test" = %rp_test%
    text: "this is a test" #ex "this is a test" = out: "this is a test" (Players without permission)
    permission: "example.1" #Permission to see the "text_with_permission" string
